## Hey there, I'm Eli!

I'm studying at Midway University and I am from Charlotte, North Carolina with a passion for soccer, music production, and Pokémon.  
Currently, I'm studying **Cybersecurity** and hope to build a career in that field.

My next **BIG** project that I currently am working on and want to finish is a Pokemon ROM HACK of Fire Red!

But other than that...

Welcome to my homepage — feel free to explore my projects and see what I’ve been working on!
